# Auto-Irrigation-System

The problems regarding the manual irrigation system were  analyzed and noted. This project aims to solve those problems and thus, add  more value to the new and efficient Auto-irrigation system. 



## Hardware used:

* Our system provide water to the plants whenever the soil is dry. In this system, we have used a soil moisture to sense the moisture level of the soil. 

* We have used a light dependent resistor (LDR) to identify day or night. We have used submersible water pump to provide water to the soil.

* Resistors 10k and 100 ohms have been used here to control current flow and divide the voltages, breadboard for prototyping our project, jumper wires to make connections between all the hardware components, LEDâ€™s to detect the signals we want the user to receive. And last, but not least, Arduino-UNO to interacts through sensor with environment and process according to the program stored in it and performs output operation.
